However new blood in the kitchen seems to have revitalized the food from other customers recent visits. Waitstaff was warm but unobtrusive. By 8 pm or so when we left the bar was full and the dining room was much more lively than it had been. Perhaps Beverly residents prefer a later seating. \n\nAfter reading the mixed reviews of late I was a little tentative over our choice but luckily there was nothing to worry about in the food department. We started with the fried dough, burrata and prosciutto which were all lovely. Then although they don't offer half portions of pasta we each ordered the entree size and split them. We chose the tagliatelle bolognese and a four cheese filled pasta in a creamy sauce with bacon, asparagus and grana frita. Both were very good. We split a secondi which was the special Berkshire pork secreto, which was described as a pork skirt steak with garlic potato purée and romanesco broccoli (incorrectly described as a romanesco sauce). Some tables received bread before the meal but for some reason we did not. \n\nManagement also seems capable for when the tenants in the apartment above began playing basketball she intervened and also comped the tables a dessert. We ordered the apple dumpling with gelato and it was also quite tasty. Portions are not huge which I particularly like because I prefer to order courses. If you are someone who orders just a meal you may leave hungry depending on you appetite. Dining room was mostly younger crowd while the bar was definitely the over 40 set. Would recommend that the naysayers return to see the improvement although I personally don't know the former glory to be able to compare. Easy access to downtown Salem without the crowds on this month of October.","date":"2014-10-11 03:34:02"}

Bolt is a follow up of Fanny's Fabrics, which closed. Like Fanny's, the selection is small. The fabrics lean toward contemporary.

However, my mother and I both bought fabric there, and we both had the same problem: the employee helped us calculate our yardage without taking the repeat into consideration. I brought my pillow forms with me, so there was no doubt exactly how large they were. My mother was able to make her project work, but I came up a pillow short. By the time the pillows were made, I realized I was short, and I returned to Bolt (all in a month's time), the fabric had sold out, with no plans on reordering. \n\nFortunately for me, I was just making a number of large throw pillows.

I hate going out and ordering a burger that is bigger than my head that I can't even finish half of! Flip's burgers are about the same size I would make for myself at home.\n\nThe second time I went I had a limited time seasonal offering which was a venison burger with pea shoots, some kind of cheese that reminded me of brie, and a very sweet syrupy sauce which I could have done without, but overall it was very good. I also had onion rings and they were possibly the best onion rings I've had ever.\n\nThe only thing I don't really like about Flip is the atmosphere and layout of the tables. I guess they were going for trendy upscale or whatever, but it makes me feel as if I am in a school cafeteria back in high school. I don't like it. There are long white tables shoved up against each other with uncomfortable modern looking plastic chairs that kind of look like they came from Ikea. It's also pretty loud in there because there is nothing to absorb the sound, like a school cafeteria.\n\nThe last time I was in there there were a couple of women with small children. I have no idea why someone would bring a child to Flip unless that child was a very adventerous eater. They don't make anything plain. Everything on the menu has some pretty exotic ingredients.

The evaluation, as with most lasik places, was complementary and all followup exams and treatments are included.  These exams are generally about 10 minutes.\n\nThe pre-surgery paperwork and going over post-op details, etc took about 30 minutes and the surgery itself (both eyes) took 25 minutes. Numbing drops are applied, so there is no pain, but while the flap is being created, there is an intense feeling of pressure from the suction that holds your eye still. I hated that. Afterward, the only pain I experienced was similar to getting soap in my eye, a kind of stinging. I went home and slept all night and woke up the next morning for my first followup and I could see! And had no more burning! I had some broken blood vessels from the suction used to hold my eye in place, but no pain all week, just dry eyes. The week following, you must avoid swimming, exercise, eye makeup, and have to sleep with goggles (so you don't rub your eyes) and apply drops almost constantly. \n\nI believe I've made a great investment.

Yes, I was swayed by another Yelper to go to Rosebud, even while fully aware that I didn't want the $5 Mystery Monday meal (biscuits and gravy with a fried egg - looked good when I saw James H.'s, Emily R.'s and Alain L.'s orders, but just not something I really like at all) so I was probably getting myself into a grossly-tempting land of foodiness, given all the other things I know or think sound goody good on their menu. I went anyway!I wanted the company and I'm so used to dining out, I couldn't resist, I suppose!!\n\nLong story short, the service was Capital-B Bad. BAD. Slow. Inattentive. As Lauren S. noted, no refills on water, plus other drinks were slow and things like James H.'s grits side and Emily R.'s fries were either forgotten (the former) or delayed and without steak sauce (the latter). Then, the first few folks to cash out clearly asked for separate checks, fiiiiiiinally got one that was all together, had to ask for it to be corrected . . . only to find that each one had a 20% \"service charge\" tacked on. Huh?! We all sat in the bar area, the group just kinda grew as people filtered in, and nowhere on the menu does it mention anything about an auto-add for \"big parties.\" Besides, I thought it was insulting because pretty much everyone at the table goes there a lot or at least often-enough to have talked with Ron and be a pretty familiar \"face\" - and we're Yelpers, so we're gonna tip you (oh, and PS? Not everyone ordered the $5 special, like Kathleen M. with her shrimp-n-grits or Lauren S. with her breakfast bowl . . . no one was gonna stiff them!).\n\nStill, our first three dining companions left without much fanfare, and I figured, \"hey, bad night.\" Then . . . the rest of us got ready to leave and a) our server took for-freakin'-ever to bring checks, and b) (the last straw in my book) dropped Emily R.'s to-go box on the floor, picked it up and resealed it, and dropped it in front of her like nothing had happened. Oh, did I mention that while we were waiting on our checks, we got to see several other servers (note: not ours) eating some of Ron's wings at the bar with \"regulars\" (as he later described them)?? Yeah, it was a BAD night at Rosebud.\n\nSo when our server finally came back with the checks, I spoke up. My intention was to let him know that we were \"nonplussed\" and, as I stated to him, he should remove the \"automatic 20% service charge if he'd included it.\" A couple minutes later, Ron came out to \"chat.\"\n\nI have to say . . . I'm \"a little bit embarrassed\" because I'm not the diner who wants her meal comped for any little reason, or, really, ever, unless it's a gracious gesture on management's part. And when Ron came over, it felt, well, like our server had tattled to Daddy . . . and that Ron didn't really want to hear what had happened. He said most of the right things, and \"agreed\" with comments, but suddenly I felt like I was the only one speaking up, he didn't *really* care, he noted he'd worked \"80 or 90 hours\" in the last week (ok, but you're the owner, right? The resto business is nothing close to easy . . . what does that have to do with our conversation??), and he tried to defend his server as well as justify the service charge . . . and then he said \"I can see where this is going . . . let me just take care of all of your dinners.\"\n\nWell, sh*t. Not really what I wanted to have happen. Honestly, it just seemed like an easy out to get *me* (us) to STHU. And then . . . how do I tip on a non-dinner? Especially one where I just had Bloody Mary's once noting how sloooow everyone's food orders came, despite being tempted? And do I just take it as a \"freebie\" given my week of Eat On $30 challengedom?? It was all too much. It seemed we all left awkwardly (not to mention that Kathleen, James, and Lauren had to pay, including a \"service charge\" and we didn't) and while Emily \"tipped for me\" since I didn't eat, but she knew I felt weird, I left with the overall thought . . . \"Huh?? What just happened??\"\n\nMonday. I will chalk it all up to Monday. I really like Rosebud and want to continue going often and recommending it to folks, but I left feeling -and still feel - like I need to *digest* my most recent experience . . .","date":"2009-10-13 22:20:10"}

I work on Krog Street, so figured I would give it a shot today. The line was VERY Long (about 10 people deep), which must mean it is good. I waited, and waited, and waited in line for about 20 minutes. My co-workers went to Fred's and had ordered and almost finished their food by the time I sat down at a table. I stuck it out in line though. The people behind the counter are very slow. Maybe because they have only been open for three weeks they are still working on the process. There is room for improvement on \"moving orders through the line.\"\n\nIt's basically like a burrito place, but Mediterranean food. I got the pita Shawarma ($8) which was a little pricey considering this was their smallest size. One size up is basically a Mediterranean tortilla which was $14. That is VERY steep vs a burrito place being about $6.50 or $7.\n\nThey did a great job loading it up though with lots of sauces and vegis. Food wise, I would give them a 4 as everything tasted great.

Yelp led us to Comfort.   So worth it!\n\nThis is a new place, and I guess Watertown is giving them a hard time about signs, as they don't have one yet.  To get there, find the Persian restaurant below and head up the stairs.\n\nThere's a small bar (with a large TV) that opens into a lovely, warm dining room.  The ceiling is high and sloped, the exposed brick adorned with a small, gold threaded tapestry.  We were the only ones there, and got to sit by the window.\n\nWe were served by the owner, who was super nice and very attentive.  He really cared that we enjoyed our food, and seemed like an all around nice guy.\n\nI tried the mac and cheese, which was rich, flavorful and wonderful.  The green beans that accompanied it were cooked and seasoned well.  My cohort ordered buffalo wings and a salad.  I was able to try the latter, and was impressed at how fresh everything was.  He enjoyed his wings, which says a lot as he's from Buffalo and is impossible to please when it comes to these things.  I was able to sample the blue cheese that came with the wings and was really impressed.  It wasn't just blue cheese - I could distinctly taste gorgonzola in there.  I asked the owner about it, and he confirmed it.  He then added that pretty much everything (including said dressing) was made on site.  That says a lot, if you ask me.\n\nOh, and I'd like to thank the bartender for leaving off the sugar on my martini glass.  Sugar is like an unnecessary set of very sticky training wheels.  Three cheers for a decent lemon martini.\n\nWe were the only ones in the dining room tonight.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the privacy and quiet of the empty room, but something tells me Comfort shouldn't remain a secret.  Get thee to Comfort.  And while you're at it, bring me back some of that blue cheese \/ gorgonzola yumminess.","date":"2008-04-30 01:39:05"}

However, I have to give them props because it seems like they're using Yelp in the right way - they're using it to get a consensus and improve on things. I read about tomatillos a while ago online, and since then I've been curious to try it. After a productive study session, I went with a friend here for lunch. Their special sounded tempting, but after having seen their menu online, I've been dying to try their potato and green chile burrito, so that's what I ordered. Since we were there for lunch, the guy at the counter told me they actually had a lunch special where for $8 you could get a burrito, chips and a drink. Sounded like a pretty good deal, so I got it. This is where I hand it to them. I assumed that all the extra toppings cost, well, extra, but there was no longer a price written next to them like there was on the menu I saw online. I then found out that they aren't, so I also got roasted corn and avocado added to my burrito (I didn't want to add too much and have the burrito be untenably huge!). My friend ordered a shrimp quesadilla and had like four extra toppings added to his.\n\nThere were a couple of minor things that bothered me. After ordering at the counter, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to go up and get my burrito once they called it out, or if I was supposed to wait for someone to bring it to me. There's nothing stated anywhere, and they surely didn't say anything, so I just went up and got it. But then a couple after us had their food brought to them by the guy at the counter. Hmm. Odd. I was also kinda \"meh\" on the salsa at the table, and the chips that came with my lunch special. The chips tasted a little greasy to me, and the salsas just weren't that great. I was expecting the tomatillo salsa to be amazing, considering the name of the restaurant was called tomatillos. Instead, it just tasted like they added waaaaaaaaay too much lime juice to me. I cannot remember a single thing about the red salsa, which just is a bad sign, considering I ate there like 3 hours ago.\n\nI will say though, that the potato and green chile was AMAZING. Definitely the best parts of the burrito were the very nicely seasoned potatoes, and the absolutely delicious blend of cheese they used inside. Pinto beans were nicely cooked, too. I'm kind of meh on the roasted corn, but since I didn't pay extra, that wasn't really a deal breaker for me.\n\nI definitely will be coming back here. They have ample parking, the space is really nice, and I really appreciate the fact that they seem to be doing their homework and improving what they can. I really think if they continue the way that they are, that this place will just get better with time.","date":"2011-11-29 23:53:15"}

But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table.\n\nThe service was also slow, mainly because as our waitress noted, they don't have trays so she couldn't carry drinks or food for 4 people, which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar.  Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant.  I mean, how out of place would that be?  Trays?  In a restaurant?  I can't imagine.  That would be like having alcohol at a bar.  Too foreign a concept.\n\nAnyway.  I get it isn't the best or classiest place downtown, so I cut it some slack, but an obscene wait for food and a borderline inept waitress are two things you don't want to deal with on a Thursday when you are a hung over and hungry group because you all maybe had one martini too many the previous night.","date":"2013-01-02 15:59:38"}

That is what I ordered.)  Next I'm told they can't use the machine because it isn't on. Long story short I get my coffee after 10 minutes.

We've had the following salesman help us over the years - Mo Jafari, Salah Husein, and Drew (can't remember his last name)....and we can't forget the one who has always been the one to 'make it all happen' - Josh Ford ( who was once the Sales Manager and now is a one of the Finance Managers). Each time we've gone in there, we presented them with some pretty tough challenges as to what we want to get out of and get in to, the negative equity that always seems to be involved, and the little down payment we never seem to have. But no matter how impossible our requests have seemed, they have always welcomed the challenges and have gone above and beyond to 'make it happen' for us and make sure we leave their lot a happy (and returning) customer. Just to share an example: My husband wanted a car on a Subaru lot really bad! But that dealership wouldn't give him the amount he wanted for his trade-in, so the numbers didn't work, which means he couldn't get the car. Well, when we told Beaverton Toyota about it, they went over to that Subaru lot, bought the car, brought it back to their lot, gave my husband what he was asking for his trade-in, and sold him the Subaru themselves! We were in shock and awe at how above and beyond they went. They don't try to convince you to 'settle for something else' because what you really want is too much of a challenge in making the numbers work. Their attitudes are 'BRING IT!' When it comes to the sales part of their jobs, they aren't pushy at all, annoying, or smothering, which I for one can highly appreciate as I HATE the car buying process (despite the fact that I've traded a car in almost every year for the past few years)! They show and express that they really care about what it is YOU want and also show that your safety and comfort (and that of your passengers) is important to them as well. They are always very patient (I speak from experience as I am not the easiest person to do business with), respectful, professional, and relaxed.

I've been to so many other dealerships and I've never have had the kind of experience with them that I do with Beaverton Toyota.

I walked into this place around 5:30p on a Tuesday and there are seven workers sitting around and no customers in the store.  I went in to find out about a cracked screen on my galaxy I got three weeks ago- didn't drop it or have anything hit it to my knowledge.  I figured it happens and was lucky I had insurance and was willing to pay the deductible.  Some guy named Chauncey looked annoyed to have to help (which he didn't help at all so I don't know why he was annoyed).  Immediately thought of everything they could say to get rid of me.  I purchased at a third party store, not a corporate store (had no clue of this myself); I could pay $350 and cancel the contract if I didn't like it; I could buy a knew one.  Now I know why everyone hates Sprint- they don't care about their customers.  Then some other worker wanders over and says, \"you know it can crack if you carry it in your pocket\" and walked off like she had just saved the day.  This place is terrible.

We got a few things to share, starting with the cottage fries, which are basically thickly sliced potato chips. We got the beet salad which wasn't bad, but wasn't my favorite. They did marinate the beets in strawberry juice, which I've never seen done before. \n\nFor the entrée, we got the shrimp and grits, and it was incredible. The grits were creamy and dreamy on their own, but with the other ingredients including a poached egg, I could not stop eating even if I tried.  We also shared the chicken sausage, which was surprisingly very flavorful for what I was expecting.

They bring a two-tiered production with a basket of fresh tortilla chips and 5 or 6 different salsas, all of which were delicious and not at all 'omg my mouth, it's on fire'\n\nI ordered a house margarita (rocks with salt please!) which was ass kicking in a good way. For my dinner I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas, which I admit were served to me in a unfamilliar way. Maybe I was just Dumb White Girl but when they brought my food I thought they brought soft tacos instead of a quesadilla. Granted, I'd ordered the corn tortillas rather than flour, and it looked like a plate with several soft tacos. And oh man, were those some seriously delicious quesadillas!

It's not my imagination because my wife noticed my plate and said the same thing.  \n\nI ordered a combo plate that you can choose up to four items.  I wanted three, and asked to just double up on the eggplant (which I ALWAYS do). The waitress said there would be a $2 up charge to double eggplant or babaganoush.  I looked at the menu, and the appetizer portion (which is bigger than the combo portion) of eggplant is only $1 more than the other items.  So where did the other dollar come from??  The babaganoush was the exact same price on the appetizer menu as the other items!  So where did the $2 up charge come from??  It made no sense to me whatsoever, but I did't feel like arguing about it.  Even if there was a legitimate reason for the up charge, they should have it on the menu, like they do for grape leaves.  \n\nThe whole thing put a bad taste in my mouth.

You feel like you're in a down home bbq joint.  Mission accomplished.  I liked the menu and its simplicity as well. (although there was some confusion on the combo in that ribs and wings were not an option although they appeared to be.)\n\nMy first issue was with the burnt ends.  I came here for the burnt ends, because FYI, it is very hard to find burnt ends around Atlanta.  this place offered them so I came.  They were sub par in my opinion.  They were 1.5 inch cubes of dry brisket black on all sides.  This is not the burnt ends I know and love.  Definite disappointment when that was my sole purpose for coming there.\n\nOther lackluster food: the brunswick stew was just okay... tasted and looked like something you would get out of a can.  The potato salad had pretty much no flavor and the potato seemed slightly undercooked.\n\nThe good food:  I really enjoyed the okra.  I love okra, and whenever I order fried okra I assume it's going to be sliced and in corn meal.  However, they fry it whole and in almost a tempura type batter.  Very different and very tasty.  We ordered some wings and they were very good.  They're smoked and then flash fried so they are flavorful and juicy.  However, I recommend getting them in a sauce because the dry rub just isn't enough.  The pulled pork was also very good, but a little dry like it was pulled long before I ordered it.\n\nOn top of food shortcomings, there were several service issues.  The server, although very nice and polite,. was the only server working the lunch shift.  So she was obviously overwhelmed by five or six tables.  On top of that, our bill was mixed with the table next to us so when I got my bill it was over 80 dollars for the two of us.  She fixed it, but it caused a longer delay than there already was.  The service issues really weren't her fault, but management for only having one server, that was also acting as the bartender.\n\nIf I'm in the area and needing some bbq I would definitely come here again.

The appetizers were surprisingly good, they lost their crunchiness because it was delivery but a few minutes in the stove took care of that. The vegetable pakora seriously made my knees wobble it was that good. The only (barely) low point was the bread tasting a little more bland than I was expecting.

When it was done, however, instead of serving it to us (seated right in front of them), the coffees were put a few feet away (within arms reach) on the till. We waited and watched as the coffees just sat there. Several waitresses passed by ignoring the coffees. After 10 minutes somebody decided to finally serve them. They were completely cold. I really don't see why this happened. \n\nWe both ordered Cassoulet. It was bland, greasy and low quality. I'm surprised to say that the Tangine I ordered the last time I was here was actually better tasting, which is rather sad as I imagined the Tangine was a bad exception. \n\nThere are some things that were still delicious.

In addition to taking my picture at deal end, I was treated like a princess descended from elite royalty.  I was provided the finest of coffee and offered sugary confections whilst we negotiated.  My salesman was well schooled in fueling grandiose delusions of carefully coiffured women.  He played the game well.  \nI am also quite sure that I received a steak dinner out of the deal as well.\n\nKudos to you Toyota Salesman of Yonder Years in the Kingdom of New Jersey....  \n\nNow I think it's clear what's important when you buy a car.  Price, honesty, integrity and all that.   However, when you're middle aged and have binged on all available episodes of Brady Bunch | Fantasy Island | Love Boat and have grown weary of the young with all their Twittering, Blogging, Vee-logging and self-gratification, there isn't much to look forward to other than going to bed before 9PM, Channel 12 news and Geritol mixed with prune juice. If you're going to take away haggling and negotiation, please replace it with a special room for those over 40 including video games | trivia | improv | snacks | 80's one hit wonders | high quality beverages (preferably alcoholic) and karaoke.  \n\nThis was my second time at this dealership. The Salespeople were efficient but I need more than that.  I need entertainment and a feeling of victory when I purchase things in this price bracket.  I crave these things, like people crave sugar and that feeling of fullness after stuffing oneself at the annual turkey dinner.  I need to wave my keys around and strut... because I bought this car.  Finally after years of denying myself the luxury of heated seats, I have given in.  I am one with the universe now...  I am a diva and my bottom is warmed... all because of my new Honda.  There needs to be much celebration.  So sadly no disco dancing can be had here.\n\nThe showroom is pretty elaborate, lots of mirrors, people wearing suits\/dresses and a fancy shmancy staircase that looked like the ballroom in the catering hall where I had my wedding back when grunge was king (ew).  All that was missing was a huge table of fresh pastries and a DJ playing that awful macarana coordinated dance crap that I was forced to participate in.  I felt just a tad out of place in my torn jeans, high topped converse sneakers and unicorn cat t-shirt.  I think there was some grandiose plumbing fixtures in the ladies room that reminded me of those high priced remodeling jobs you see on HGTV.  Yes I do wish I had a miniature waterfall in my apartment bathroom.  I really do.  Anyway, it's rather nice, so you might want to dress up a little before your visit.  A tiara should do nicely.\n\nSummary\n\nDespite my ranting above about things that only matter to high-maintenance middle aged women transplanted from NYC,this experience went well for me.  If you want to buy a car without hassle (cool) or no negotiations (ew), from well-versed, experienced and pleasant, sales (peoples) who briskly handshake and get the job done quickly, please feel free to buy a vehicle from them.  \n\nMy name is VixenZilla and I endorse Beaverton Honda...","date":"2016-11-09 20:46:13"}

And a good massage requires a good therapist who listens to their clients. Which, unfortunately for me did not happen! \n\nI think the worst part of a bad massage is that you're all too keenly aware of that bad massage for every minute your are paying for! And you're literally counting down the minutes until it ends, which is completely counterproductive to your reason for getting the massage in the first place.\nI tried the introductory massage for NINETY minutes. Had this been a good massage, I would have been happy. I would have been ecstatic! But within minutes of my 90 minute massage commencing I knew it was going to be a bad massage.\nI had filled out a questionnaire prior to my massage session in which I Circled target\/problem areas that I wanted to have addressed, particularly my neck, shoulders, and upper back. When I met my therapist, he read my form and confirmed these specific areas with me.\nBut the bulk of my ninety minute massage was not targeted at the three areas I had requested. Instead, my therapist decided to give me the massage HE wanted to give. During my session, I repeatedly requested that he cover these areas in lieu of the other areas he focused on, mainly my arms, hands, legs, and feet.\nThis was a very looonnnggg massage...which usually is a good thing, but in this case just proved to be frustrating. I couldn't wait for it to be over.\nI literally ran out of the room when he said it was over. When the lady at the front desk started talking to me about memberships I was not interested in being here for one more minute.\n\nOn a side note regarding employment: My dear friend worked here in sales for a brief stint which is why I tried the place in the first place. He endured an injury on the job and could not walk or stand as a result of the injury, which made performing his job duties here impossible. Short story shorter...they fired him, refused to communicate with him, and never paid him his last check. \nThis place has a VERY high turnover rate, which speaks for itself.

The end of their friends' ceremony: couple has their first kiss, crowd cheers, photographer calls a halt to their walk back up the aisle so he can get a better angle.\n\nThat wasn't acceptable, and we weren't keen on having a lens constantly in our faces either.  So, one of our priorities was to find someone who could capture the day while still being unobtrusive.  Channing was perfect.  He documented all the moments we remember, as well as many that we wouldn't have seen without him.  Yet, other than when we were taking portraits, he flew under the radar, never interrupting the flow of the evening or getting in the way of our guests.\n\nAnd the photos!  Our gallery has over 700 images -- every one looks crisp and professional, and many are downright stunning.  He has an amazing eye for expressions: emotions and reactions come through so vividly that we feel like we're reliving parts of the celebration.  He's also willing to go the extra mile to get different perspectives.  During the first five minutes of our ceremony, he somehow managed to get across the building, up to a balcony, and back; he took beautiful photos of the unveiling and gorgeous panoramas showing all of our guests, and he returned before our officiant's welcome was over.  We got a glimpse of how he did it from a video of our recessional, in which he silently sprints along the side of the building to get both our first kiss and our walk up the aisle.  It couldn't have been more different from my parents' horror story, and we couldn't imagine better photographs.\n\nSeeing his site (http:\/\/www.channingjohnsonblog.com) is probably more convincing than reading this review.  We were swayed both by the impressive portfolio and by our first meeting with him, and we liked him so much that we decided to do an engagement session as well.  During that session, he set two nervous subjects at ease, and we ended up with a spectacular set of photos.  We gave them to our parents and grandparents at the wedding, and they were thrilled.\n\nFinally, working with Channing is a joy.  He is incredibly responsive and endlessly thoughtful, and he clearly cares about what he does.  He listened closely to all of our requests and concerns, and he dealt tactfully with a couple of our friends and family who insisted that he ought to take a particular picture in a particular way.  Our engagement and wedding photos came promptly, with the files mailed on disc and loaded on an online gallery.\n\nSo yes, Channing is a ninja.  He is everywhere and seems to be nowhere; he has consummate skill in his art; he is awesome.","date":"2012-11-06 03:30:52"}

When I was first looking for a provider, I was determined to get one that took all of our insurance. I started cross walking providers and finally hit MM. Obtaining approvals was a snap. Equipment and supplies delivered promptly and I made a point of stopping by for small adjustments or advice. I only have used the Manchaca location. Initially, phone calls were routed to the Stafford call center (outside of Houston I believe), and messages that were left were apparently not being forwarded to this location and there were email issues (thank you YELP reviewers for the head's up). I originally made an appointment at this location for a face to face and to confirm all insurance info. I was quite pleased, learned a lot, and prepped myself about equipment for meeting with the doctor and discussing the prescription. I always made an appointment, just to keep things easy. Now they have a new phone system installed which goes directly to that small office or if they are tied up with an appointment it goes to the north office. This has been a major factor in my rating as it is much easier to contact the specific person i want. Since this is a very small office they prioritize. Appointments first, walk-ins second. Since supplies come out of the Houston area warehouse I anticipated long delays. It appears that they are addressing warehouse issues down there, but I still maintain contact only with the Manchaca location. I am quite surprised to have a good experience so far as I was dreading dealing with this issue. I will try to update this after a few more months to see I continue to be pleased.\n\nI did a lot of checking on providers and came up with a lot of bad ones.

I Googled best cover up tattoo artists in New England and his name popped up! I checked out his Web page, followed him on Facebook, and called to snag my appointment.  He had a 3 month waiting list which I gladly accepted for quality work. \n\nLet's start with what I had. ...I had what is coined as \"a nightmare tattoo\". It was a dragon which I had done circa 1997\/1998 by a now well known tattoo artist.  A friend of mine stenciled a dragon on me, and instead of removing it I had to worked over. It was fine and barely visible until touched by then known as \"Naton\" of Dark wave Dermagraphics  located in his loft at Dudley Station in Boston, when tattooing was illegal. \n\nI left with a horrible tattoo. A marriage of pain and torment which I lived in.  I had tried endless times to have it redone and was always told it couldn't be done,  until Neil came along....\n\nAbout Empire Tattoo....it stepped in to seal the deal, and get a brutal, bloody, long overdue divorce from this tattoo.  I sat in an ultra cushiony soft leather sofa which immediately made me sleepy.  The studio was clean,  spacious, and all employees friendly.  \n\nAbout Neil....HE IS THE REAL DEAL. He takes time to analyze your existing tattoo and discusses the options.  He is a real artist.  His work space was awesome.  He calmed me with movies, we watched Push, and Casino Jack.  He has outlets to charge your cell phone,  art everywhere,  and is not only am awesome tattoo artist but a great person. He is a family man and proud of his wife, who is a true artist also. \n\nThe vibe in the studio is awesome,  positive energy and even the owner is very cool! When done, Neil sealed the deal and filed my tattoo nightmare divorce by wrapping me up in Saran wrap. I am sooooo happy, I cried out of happiness and also pain, lol.

Their cleaning employees are nice people, but awfully unprofessional and with absolutely no training.  They are basically just told to show up. There are no standards by which they must adhere, even in regards to what supplies they bring.   \n\nThe last cleaner I had brought a single rag with stains and hair on it, to clean everything, even the bathroom...and no paper towels. I opted to give her my counter cloths to use for the kitchen at least, but couldn't find it after she left.. so I guess she took it with her!   \nSince she presumably used the same rag in the toilet as everywhere else... I had to clean AGAIN after she left. \n\nThe WORST part is the customer service and overall company interaction.  \n\nFirst cleaning  - I booked using a referral promo.   I have the screenshot of what I was supposed to be charged - when I made the booking. However the charge on my credit card was DOUBLE.  **Customer service said the quoted price was due to an error in their website design and thanked me for bringing in to their attention..but did not refund me the balance.   The cleaning was just ok, but I opted to give it another try..BIG MISTAKE.  \n\nThe second cleaning:  I had a scheduling conflict and moved the cleaning by 2 hours: the online system confirmed that I would be charged a $15 fee.  However, the schedule change did not take effect, they showed up when I was not home, and my whole payment was wasted.  **Customer service told me \"nothing was rescheduled\"...they don't know why the system did not register it..no compensation offered.\n\nThe 3rd cleaning: The pro, Omar, started by texting that he was running late.  Then he texted that he could not come due to police activity in the T and HIS WORDS: ' the situation is a lil risky for me'.    I called customer service and they confirmed that he would not be coming.  They told me they would refund my credit card the full amount paid for the cleaning and also issue me a $35 goodwill credit since my whole afternoon was wasted waiting for him.   \n**The credit card refund never showed up, and when I called 2 weeks later, customer service told me that they just gave me a goodwill credit because the pro 'was late'!  \nI told them that in fact he NEVER showed up **I have his messages to prove it, and I HAD been told I was going to get the full refund to my credit card.   \n**They refused to refund the full amount. I asked them if they have customer service calls recorded, so that they can go back to Sep 16 and listen to what I was told.  The woman told me that her manager said yes they have the calls recorded, but he will not listen to them, and that she was 'proceeding to cancel this call'.. AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME.  \n\nNeedless to say I will NEVER refer anyone to Handy.  I have never in my life dealt with such disrespectful and terrible customer service.  \n\nThe concept is great, their cleaners are nice but somewhat unprofessional, but the company values are extremely sketchy.   \nBottom line: Handy is a scam..a huge waste of money AND time.","date":"2015-10-07 21:48:25"}

The nice thing about this, however, is that the various paths and trees and walking trails really scatter the guests throughout the resort so that everyone isn't right on top of each other.

My boyfriend is a smoker and he didn't mind walking to the benches to have a smoke before bed. \n\nThe rooms are a bit small, but it was only two of us so it wasn't cramped and we were in the room so little it didn't matter anyway! I would suggest if you're a family of 4 or more to get an additional room that's adjacent. They have doors between so you can keep all your family together with side by side rooms. \n\nThe food in the lobby is actually pretty good, despite it being a cafeteria.

I had previously heard that management was planning on keeping a few of HD1's mainstays on the menu, but unfortunately only the 'Haute Dog' made it. \n\nNo biggie, the BF and I both decided on burger options; he had the \"Oaxaca Burger\"  (beef patty topped with sliced avocado, pico de gallo, and smoked mayo). I was a litle hesitant trying it -  it sounded much too spicy for my wimpy taste buds - but the spice was surprisingly mild. Good news for me, but bad news if you're looking for some kick. The burger itself was well-cooked, very tender, and the toppings were a very refreshing contrast to the beef.\n\nI chose their special of the day: the \"Surf and Turf\" Burger (beef patty, topped with sauteed lobster knuckles, \"garlic herb white wine butter\", pea shoots, and green goddess dressing) which came with a side of seasoned fries - served with mayo and ketchup ($16). The adjectives were just too much for me to resist, I had to have it. I wasn't disappointed it was quite tasty, it was the same beef patty of the 'Oaxaca' - the lobster was buttery and well cooked, also more plentiful than I thought there'd be. Always a plus!\n\nWe finished our meal by sharing the Pistachio \"Liquid Nitrogen\" milkshake. No surprise, I loved it. I really like that the milkshakes have a more complex sweetness to them, there's a muti flavor component to them as well. \n\nThe service was excellent, our server was friendly and attentive. There was a slight delay in our entrees coming out - but the manger came out straightaway and apologized profusely.\n\nMy one tiny complaint\/tip regarding Flip (all locations) - the burgers are quite small - hella tasty and gourmet - but small.

From the phone call to see if they were open to the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and the friendliness was obviously sincere. The place does look like a veritable tapas bar (memories of Spain). The menu was everything I had hoped. Fortunately Karly (or Carly?) was very helpful and we managed to choose some top notch tapas (although I can't imagine anything here not being delish).

Even signed up for a Yelp account today to encourage them to increase their professionalism.\n--------------------------\nMore details: Needing to use the bathroom after downing my taro drink, I made for the door with the large bathroom sign on it. An Asian staff guy came out of nowhere, literally stuck his arm out across my chest, and forcibly pushed me away. \"Bathroom's closed,\" he said in an abrupt, dismissive tone. Thinking he thought I might have just come in from the street, I let him know, \"I'm a paying customer.\" Grinning sardonically, he mocked, \"Are you also a reading customer?\" He pointed to a small sign on the side counter saying the bathroom was reserved for staff only. My mistake, but when I have to pee, I'm usually not looking around for small disclaimers. Did he need to make assumptions and say it the way he did? I might have expected such attitude from myself in college, but not out of people running a business. So I let him know, \"No, I'm not. I'm not going to be a customer at all anymore.\"\n\nHere comes my favorite part. His response? A snarky laugh with other staff, followed by \"That's fine with me.\"\n\nBTS, you were a staple in my college years; I was there when you first opened behind the post office!

I had seen so many good reviews that I couldn't wait, especially since I am terrible at doing my own hair! The atmosphere immediately excited me- music, movies, laughter...I felt like I was at a club! The women working were so nice and my stylist was super friendly. I told her I wanted loose waves and she definitely did that. The reason for two stars, however, is that my hair looked great at the salon, but 25 minutes later all of my curls fell and my hair was straight. I made sure to take a cab home just so my hair wouldn't get ruined! I was so upset because it looked amazing at the salon. I eventually had to make my friend re curl it quickly before we went out. Paying almost $50 for a blowout that immediately fell down was really frustrating. Not sure if I would go back again!","date":"2014-04-01 02:15:20"}

I probably wouldn't have gotten so bent out of shape about it if the waiter hadn't been a little taken aback that we asked about them. \n\nNow, onto the food. We all ordered burgers. And, for the most part, were happy with our choices. I had the Aunt Patty which was very tasty. The boyfriend had a bodacious bacon burger. Dad got the Texas ranger (which he loved) and Mom had a basic burger. They were all nice burgers... our issue was that none of them came cooked as we ordered. All were cooked well done.

I have had many memorable times coming to your farm to pick fruits, pumpkins and feast on the goodies sold in your market. I expected the same experience today, but sadly, was greatly mistaken. \n\nI came to pick raspberries, but because it was raining, was in the market area waiting for the rain to subside. While I was contemplating buying a flat, one of your employees brought over a sign that raised the price of the flats and stuck it on the cart. When I remarked about the price, she flippantly said that I was too slow and should have gotten it sooner.\n\nI saw you come over and was about to make a comment, when you interrupted me and said, \"that's what supply and demand is.\" And walked away.\n\nI would like to believe that you and your staff were just having a bad day and that customers usually are usually treated with better customer service instead of being subjected to the blatant price hikes and rude comments I experienced today.\n\nYour \"lesson\" in supply and demand was taken to heart. And I'm sorry to say that I will never be coming back to support your market again. Also, I will encourage my friends and colleagues who are looking for farm fresh produce and fruits to consider alternative more customer friendly establishments. \n\nI know my change in patronage will not impact your bottom line at all, but I would encourage you to think about what true customer service means and practice that with your other patrons, before the demand for your goods drops due to how you treat your customers.\n\nSincerely,\nFormer Kreuger farms fan","date":"2013-06-24 07:14:55"}

Michael gave my hair the time and attention it has desperately needed for a long time, with a set of amazingly bright, light highlights, the kind my other stylists could not deliver.

Interesting, in a \"what?\" kind of way.  But I've pretty much forgotten what I  had.  The wife had a waffle... for the price it should have been orgasmic, it was not in the top 50% of her waffle experiences.

I don't know if it means anything on how the place was doing that day, but my latte did not have any cute art on top.  Maybe it WAS an off day.  Or maybe they didn't like us :O\n\nService...  Ok, friendly, but disorganized.  It was fairly busy, but they had lots of staff.\n\nThe building and how they used it was great!  Nice and quirky.  That is what moved me to consider 3 stars.

We ordered:\n\nSalmon tartar ($9): this came in a martini glass with nori wrappers on the side. I liked the combination of the chopped salmon, salmon roe, avocado and mango in a soy dressing.\n\nBlack cod miso ($14): this was really good, not too overpowered by the miso, but the slice of black cod was pretty small. However, I would order it again since it tasted good.\n\nSushi set ($20): this came with a California roll and various pieces of sushi. They use real crab in the roll, and it tasted pretty good.\n\nAssorted tempura dinner set $14): the tempura was nice and lightly fried. The dinner set came with miso soup, rice, sunonomo, and spinach.\n\nWe were getting full by this point, so we didn't order the famed crème brulee, so we'll have to make sure to save room for dessert next time.

We like the convenience of the area and the rent is affordable compared to the other surrounding complexes, so each year, we have renewed or lease despite the lack of communication in the front office and the incompetence of the maintenance staff. You sign up for alerts and request phone calls before maintenance decides to enter your apartment (when they finally do come after 2-3 weeks since your request), and they call 1% of the time if that, and you can forget about the text alerts. We have had an ongoing issue with leaks that never seem to be fixed-- just a band-aid put over it. The walls and flooring are thin, or maybe they didn't put padding down when installing the carpet because it always sounds like an earthquake or WWF match coming from upstairs. I could hear a pin drop from upstairs-- I hear everything. Whoever is in charge of beautification of the neighborhood does a decent job, but they tend to neglect the breezeways and apartments that are on the back side of the building. I am constantly picking up garbage and trash bags -- yes, trash bags that have been tossed from someone's balcony and into the wooded area. Just because I don't live in the front of the building where everything is visible, doesn't mean I want to see trash every time I open my front door or look outside my window. I've complained about this several times and I'm always told that a $25 fee will be charged to the people who do this and that they will investigate the trash bags to find the culprit, but I know this isn't being done. Overall, we feel safe and have not heard of any dangerous incidents happening here, so that is definitely a pro. I can walk to the grocery store and run on a treadmill in the fitness center if I don't feel like driving to my gym. The leasing office and entrance of the neighborhood is nice.

I know good help is hard to find, but this is something they can work on to help with the dining experience. Despite that minor tweak, LOVE this place!!!!","date":"2012-04-28 17:11:47"}

A very basic menu, which makes sense considering they started out as a good truck. I got the veggie burger because the description sounded unique- and it did not disappoint! The fries were hot, salty and delicious, and I enjoyed dipping them in the ketchup, which almost tasted like it had some BBQ sauce mixed into it! I was tempted by the milkshake menu, but saved my dessert splurge for another place. Super easy to just sit at the counter and get served, even on a crazy Saturday night in summer when Ponce City Market was packed.","date":"2017-08-28 19:43:14"}

Our destination of choice?  Ma Soba, a pan-Asian and sushi restaurant in Beacon Hill.  Opened in 1999, the restaurant has an impressive array of awards.  Needless to say, we were pretty excited to try it out.\n\nWe were greeted at the door by a friendly face, but his was the last smile we would see that evening.  Our server ignored us for several minutes after stopping by just long enough to fill our water glasses, and when she did return, only wanted to know if we had \"decided what we wanted\".  She took our order and left.  Not that she didn't do her job well; she was tremendously efficient.  Our water glasses were full all night, and she timed the courses perfectly.  But a smile and a little hospitality certainly would have made us feel a lot more comfortable.\n\nWe hit a home run with our appetizers.  My boyfriend ordered the pork gyoza, and they were crispy on the outside, warm and moist on the inside.  My miso soup was excellent.  For our main course, we split the Shogun Boat, which consisted of eight pieces of Sushi, fifteen pieces of Sashimi, a Tuna Roll, a Caterpillar Roll and a California Roll.  Now, we knew Ma Soba was not the top sushi restaurant in Boston.  It's not too pricey, so we knew not to expect phenomenal sushi.  With that in mind, we were very pleased with the presentation, the selection and the quality.  We were quite content after our main course, even if our server had yet to crack a smile.  \n\nHowever, the biggest disappointment was yet to come.  We ordered the green tea mochi, and we were horrified when my boyfriend's fork made a resounding \"clank\" against  it as he tried to cut into it.  I attempted a bite of my piece, but after chunks of freezer burn ice fell into my mouth, decided to follow my better judgment and send the mochi back.  We were disappointed that the restaurant even served us such sub-standard fare.\n\nWe left disappointed.  The sushi itself was as expected, but the service, the awful dessert and the lack of ambiance in the restaurant ultimately left us unsatisfied.  I doubt we'll go back.","date":"2009-10-13 03:48:11"}

Very minimal. I got most of what I asked for, but upon a closer look my nails (which are naturally grown) were definitely not almond shaped. They're honestly only slightly different in shape than what I came in with. And as I was getting my nails filed by the first lady, she said that she usually charges $7 extra for filing almond-shaped nails, but because it was my first time she would waive the fee--which was nice of her, but I didn't know people charged extra for certain shapes! Or maybe I'm just ignorant when it comes to nail salons (this was my first time going in about 7+ years). The other woman who gave me the manicure (not the same who shaped my nails) did an OK job. She was polite and friendly, and the coat was even. But the dots didn't all have a consistent size and one of them is totally crooked. But honestly, I could live with the lopsided dots. It's the shape I'm really disappointed about. I thought \"almond\" is a universal shape and thus that she knew what I meant--even after showing her a picture. \n\nThe plus side is that my mani only cost about $30 but it's still more than I would've paid for not getting the right shape. Maybe what I wanted was too simple. Or maybe they just didn't understand what I wanted. If I do come back (and it's likely that I won't, partially because of my experience and partially because I rarely get my nails done) I'll shape my own nails at home.","date":"2018-07-17 01:00:36"}

Real Ale has only recently began to bottle this fabulous, light beer...one of my Austin favs.  The beer variety is phenomenal, I was astounded, almost to the point of tears upon exploring the aisle.  The beers are arranged by location, it seems.  There's an Austin\/Texas area, moving into a US microbrew-ish area.  Across the aisle are the imports from Italy, Canada, Holland, Germany, and the like.  The Asian beers were off in another aisle, across from the oh-so-yucky Anheiser-Busch products and the like.  There was also a somewhat impressive selection of Mexican beers.\n\nI was overwhelmed by the wine selections.  They have everything that your oenophile heart could ever desire.  Since I was looking for nothing specific, I had no reason to ask help of any of the associates.  Come to think of it, I didn't really see any associates, save for the registers and at the deli.\n\nThere is also a section of finer foods and libation accessories.  Briefly looking through them, I was impressed by the wine selection of wine racks (I wish I would've known about this place when I bought mine) and candies.  Yum!  \n\nUnfortunately, but my liver probably thanks me, I was financially unable to purchase anything.

(OK, to tell you the truth it seemed like a hassle to be sent sample frames, send them back etc.) But while on vacation in Austin 2 weeks ago, I noticed this huge Warby Parker store downtown and figured it couldn't hurt to see if I could at least pick out frames there and then order online. Well, turns out it was MUCH easier than that; in fact, I never had to go online at all!

I came here for a conference in July and found that with all the wings in this hotel it can be very confusing to get around and get lost. Also there was a dance competition going on at the same time that seemed to bleed into our area.\n\nThe food supplied at lunches and dinner was good every time, no real complaints. A little better than standard hotel conference food- however one of my roommates for the conference was a vegetarian and she was not happy with the tofu option that was provided at EVERY meal.\n\nNext, I found the pool to not have very much space to accommodate enough people at all. We went outside at 1pm and found not one single spot to sit. This would dissuade me from coming back to this hotel.\n\nThe food in the restaurants was very expensive, hard to find  quick cheap lunch in our off time. Additionally, the bar they had open at night by the entrance to the hotel was VERY expensive for a drink. I am talking 13-17$ per drink. No thank you.\n\nLastly, my biggest issue was the bathroom in our hotel room. It was great and all that a TV was in the mirror- not gonna lie, that was COOL. However, there were slots in the bathroom door so there was no real privacy at all. It was like the slots on a closet door? I was rooming with some people that I was not as familiar with and I was turned off by this- especially for how expensive it is to stay here! I later learned that not all the rooms were like this, only on our wing.","date":"2016-08-25 15:42:13"}

Fortunately a friend was still on the way, and accepted our telephoned request to please pick up some food on her way over.\n\nMarvel's Lunch Box accepts credit cards, which was great since I figured our friend would not have enough cash on hand to pay for our order.\n\nWhen she arrived with two bags in hand, we took account, and discovered that the fried clams were sadly MIA.  She headed right back, got the clams, an apology, and a two courtesy bowls of soups for our trouble.\n\nFor herself, she got the Crab Roll $13.95 - Sweet lump and back fin meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll \/ includes coleslaw.\n\nThe portion of meat was okay, and the meat fresh, but she felt the bread to meat ratio was just too high and the bun quite filling.\n\nThe rest of us shared two ¼ Lb Lobster Roll $18.95 (Made to order, select claw and knuckle meat, lightly dressed with mayonnaise, a touch of diced celery, and a subtle spice blend, placed on a bed of romaine lettuce, and served on a toasted brioche roll \/ includes coleslaw.), the Pint Ipswich Clams $17.95 (Sweet small-bellied clams prepared in our house batter \/ includes tartar sauce and lemon.) and a large order of Onion Rings $5.50.\n\nI liked the onion rings because the crisp batter enclosed thick rings of onions, and the whole fried clams had a satisfying crispness as well, though they were not the best of the season for me, as that accolade went to a spot up in Maine and has yet to be dethroned.  The lobster roll was too light on the lobster for the price, but the beautiful brioche roll was generously buttered and toasted quite well.  Too much grease for the health conscious, but go big or go home!\n\nWe enjoyed the clam chowder - both the surprise and the taste of it - and were pleased to find corn kernels amidst the clams and the potato cubes.  The other soup looked like minestrone till we discovered a slice of kielbasa here and an oyster there.  Good, but my preference was towards the chowder.\n\nThough we ordered 4 items, they gave us 5 cole slaws so we could each have one, and we shared the 3 tartar sauces, which was plenty for the job.

I have no doubt if he or someone with a similar skill set was in the kitchen, Flip Burger would be 5 stars.  You are giving 5 star ingredients to a burger flipper, which isn't quite going to cut it.\n\nWe started off with the poutine appetizer.  Poutine is popping up everywhere lately.  This version was underwhelming.  There really wasn't any meat in this dish.  The fries are cooked in beef fat and the gravy is chorizo based, but I couldn't find much chorizo in it.  It should also have cheese curds, but those were absent as well.  What we had here was a savory creamy sauce poured over french fries, topped with two fried eggs.  Unfortunately the egg whites were still runny, which I'm not a fan of.  It's amazing that it's so hard for a cook to get the yolks runny and the whites cooked.  There was plenty of fries so my buddy and I kind of just left the ones that were touched by the clear uncooked egg white.  2 stars  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=nxZc_vqqUeAxzWFcWMhzXQ\n\nI was very excited to try a Milkshake here, specifically the Krispy Kreme shake.  I don't know if they blend up an whole Krispy Kreme glazed donut in there, but it sure tasted exactly like drinking one.  It was delicious.  My only disappointment was at the use of the liquid nitrogen.  Of course if you've watched Richard Blais on Top Chef, you know he enjoys using it.  So these shakes have Liquid Nitrogen added to them.  Unfortunately this molecular gastronomy technique was left to our server\/ hostess.  It consisted of her pouring a little bit of liquid nitrogen over the top of the milkshake, which made it smoke a little bit.  This can't be what Blais intends here, as it added nothing but a little flair.  I've had ice cream blasted with liquid nitrogen before and it's usually used to get a crunchy outer shell, which would have offered an interesting texture.  It also can be added to the process of making ice cream which lends itself to smaller crystals, thus giving it a smoother texture.  This was a pretty smooth creamy shake, so perhaps that's what's going on here.  The top of my shake that had the liquid nitrogen poured on it was a goopy mess.  4 stars  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=V7XgrE_YOV-BkIJe2xLdXg\n\nAs for the burger, I went with the Earth & Turf Burger.  This patty is a blend of ground beef and ground mushrooms, and I loved the blend.  It was topped with caramelized onions, sautéed mushrooms, gruyere cheese, pickles, and a delicious mushroom mayo.  Lots of little chopped up pieces of mushrooms were mixed in with the mayo.  If you love mushrooms, this is your burger.  I ordered it medium rare.  From the first bite, I thought this is a 5 star burger and outstanding.  Unfortunately the burger flipper, didn't give me a medium rare burger, or even a medium burger.  It was closer to medium well, and fully cooked all the way through.  Now the quality of the beef saved it.  It was still very juicy and I enjoyed every bite.  However, the burger flipper's job is to do one thing, and that's pretty much cook a burger correctly.  A real chef wouldn't have messed that up.  Even still I'm giving this burger 4.5 stars.  http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/flip-burger-boutique-atlanta?select=YAVwD_oolsY8kSVS4LAnhQ\n\nMy buddy also enjoyed his burger, but it was also medium well, rather than the medium rare he ordered.  We were the first diners of the day and ours were the only burgers the cook had to pay attention to, so it's not like he lost track of them.  Oh well, that's the problem with a chain style restaurant where the Top Chef is absent.  And lack of execution keeps Flip Burger from getting 5 stars from me.  But I'll be happy to eat that over cooked mushroom burger anytime.\n\n*Also of note, they say they are open until 11pm, but we were turned away at 10:45 pm, which we weren't too happy about.  If you don't want to take customers up until your closing time, then change your closing time to when you do want to take them.  10:30 or whatever.  But to turn someone away while you are technically still open, only ticks off the customer.  We almost didn't return the next day after being treated like that.  Most people wouldn't have.","date":"2015-11-18 19:21:19"}

I LOVED how Elie cut and colored my hair . I referred at least a dozen customers to Elie because they all loved my hair. Last March I got my third keratin treatment in two years. I paid $250. The week before that I had gotten a cut, color, highlight and blow dry and bought some products. With tips, I spent close to $600.00 in two weeks. When I washed my hair a couple of days after the keratin my new highlights were brassy blonde and completely burnt and shriveled up. I had to straighten my hair but it looked terrible! I went to the salon and elie agreed to fix it. He toned down the highlights and cut my hair really short trying to cut the fried hair out but it still looked terrible. When I went back for my next cut I told him I was really upset and he assured me he was going to fix it. Not only did he not fix it, because it can't be fixed, but he charged me. The next appointment I made with him he cancelled and I had to go to somebody else because I couldn't get another appointment for weeks. So when I was getting close to needing another haircut I went into the salon and made an appointment and I told him I was upset about all the money I paid for the keratin. He said we will talk when you come in for appointment. I went in the following week for my appointment on a Monday and he had called in sick. I asked when next appointment was and they couldn't offer me anything til Friday at 4:30! I told receptionist I work til 5pm and could be there at 5:15 and she said sorry, he is booked. I have tried to contact the owner twice via their website but haven't heard a word from them.....hmmmm....I know they have my number because they have called to cancel twice!

I eventually went for the awesome looking brunch menu and ordered way too much for two people:\n\n- Pulled Pork Corn Muffin ($6)\nThis is listed under sides, but it came out first and was a really delicious start to the meal. It's less like a corn muffin, and more like just a ton of pork with some guacamole on delicious bread.\n\n- Sunrise Poutine ($15)\nI told myself that this was a starter, so I wouldn't feel horrendous for ordering three entrees. This is way more than an appetizer and is a meal on its own. This consists of a hot pile of fries covered in scrambled eggs, gravy, cheese curds and Canadian bacon. I often regret ordering poutine when I'm left with half a plate of pure mush and sogginess, but that was not the case here at all - this was some of the best poutine I've ever had, as the fries remained super crispy throughout and were incredibly good combined with the salty Canadian bacon and the fluffy eggs.\n\n- Sunnyside Burger ($15)\nAs if we didn't get enough bacon, egg and cheese with the poutine, we also had this excellent burger with plenty more of the same piled on top of it. This was a really outstanding burger. The sunnyside egg on top was nice and runny and was just perfect with the bacon and American cheese.\n\n- Southern Belle French Toast ($12)\nAnother really excellent choice, this french toast came with two huge, juicy chicken breasts on top of it. The jalapeno jelly was a little strange, but aside from that, the chicken and french toast combo was just as good, if not better than the standard chicken and waffles.\n\nIt's a pretty hipstery crowd with hipstery, slightly lazy service.

It is all depending on what you order.  I used to be a big fan of their Chirashi.  If you read few reviews, they used fresh grated wasabi, it should have seaweed, octopus salad, real crab meat, tobiko, avocado along with fresh sashimi in a bowl of rice for only $17.  I can tell you that the Chirashi is no longer the same.  In my last 4 attempts, their Chirashi is pretty disappointing.  Very small slices of tuna (3 pcs), salmon (2 pcs), katsuo (2 pcs), saba (2 pcs) and Hamachi (2 pcs).  They did not put any seafood salad nor avocado.  Few pcs of spoiled cabbages and very little amount of rice.  I was hungry again after 2 hours, I probably would re-thinking about going there.  Yes, they do have a lot of cooked sushi option, their service is excellent.  So sad that I have to find another sushi restaurant.  I really wanted our relationships last a little longer.","date":"2016-12-19 15:18:19"}

If you can get a west facing, high story room then it's worth it.  \n\nThe only thing that could have improved that view is if they had had chairs out on the balcony.  It would have been nice to sit there and enjoy a drink.  However, now that I think about it, they probably want people to have to go to Cloud 9, their rotating restaurant and bar to do that.  \n\nThe hotel itself is outdated and we heard rumors that they are shutting it down, so maybe that's why they haven't updated it.  Our room was clean, appliances and bathroom fixtures were old and in need of some love.  The headboard of the bed banged annoyingly against the wall every time you even leaned on it. I feel bad for whoever our neighbors were.  \n\nThis hotel is also the only establishment we visited in Vancouver where I encountered irritated staff and sub par customer service.  Again, if the closing rumors are true then maybe they are just disgruntled. Both front desk employees that we spoke to seemed to be irritated by our presence.  We arrived very early and requested early check-in.  I understand that early check-in can not be guaranteed but we were told to come back at noon (an hour after check-out) and our room should be ready.  We walked around and had lunch and decided that at 1pm we had definitely given them enough time.  The next front desk employee, also annoyed by our presence, told us that check-in was at 3pm, no exceptions.  \n\nThe WiFi was slow but free.  \n\nDon't bother with Cloud 9.  The drinks are over priced and mediocre.  It takes a solid hour for the restaurant to make its turn, so unless you want to spend $50 on drinks or milk one for an hour, just go up there and walk around it and you'll get the gist.

The restaurant is on the lobby level and features space for a couple hundred restaurant guests and a FANTASTIC 40-person bar with small side rooms off the main bar that are cool, blue, hip and excellent.\n\nThe biggest key unique selling point here is the menu and the amazing food.  The food was based on a background of restaurants in the pacific northwest for inspiration.  In Oregon and Washington, sustainable eating is a bigger movement, and here at the Wave the focus is on fresh, seasonal food with huge flavor frequent organic influences...and the like.  Yes...I am writing this about the food at a major restaurant inside one of the icons of Walt Disney World.  This place is a massive departure from what you would expect.  No fries, no fried food.  But don't think it's all healthy in a dull way.  There's an amazing pork tenderloin, freshly crafted creamy soups, excellent desserts, and...for my money...the single best margarita I have ever consumed.\n\nThe fresh fish with edamame salsa and the citrus and avocado salad made me come back for a second visit.\n\nI ate there 4 times in a week at Disney.

I got their $6 pulled pork sandwich lunch special, comes with fries and it was off the chain good! Service is fast and friendly. It's a small place with super limited seating.

The issue with my Macbook Pro: My screen kept freezing and finally after two weeks it just stopped booting up.  Normally this would be a sensible conclusion that my hard drive was fried.  However, I installed an SSD a few years ago and those things rarely crash.  So I took it to MacTronics and explained that I wasn't sure what was wrong with the laptop but I assumed it was the hard drive even though it was SSD.  I was informed for them to run an diagnostics test on the laptop it would cost me 60 bucks.  If that came up with nothing they would need to open the laptop up that would be an additional 30 bucks.  I received a call two days later and I was politely told that they couldn't find out what was wrong with my laptop but they assumed it was the hard drive.  Which is what I assumed before I dropped my laptop off!  They also told me that I was 90 bucks in so far and that the next step was to erase my hard drive and reformat it to see if it was actually the hard drive.  The next step would cost me an additional 60 bucks bringing my total to 150 bucks.  When I asked if erasing my data was necessary they told me yes in order to keep troubleshooting.  I refused because I know that I can erase my own data, go to the Apple store and they can reformat my hard drive for free!  So I picked up my laptop, paid 90 bucks, and went to the Apple store.  First off, Apple ran two different diagnostics tests FOR FREE!!.  They also told me that because I installed my own hard drive that the diagnostics test will always show my hard drive as an error so they were looking for other errors.  They also agreed that SSD hard drives rarely crash so they wanted to take a look inside my Macbook Pro overnight FREE of charge.  I got a call the next day from Apple saying my laptop was fixed by merely replacing the cable that connects the hard drive to the motherboard!  Data Saved!  And it cost me 57 bucks!!  If you have an Apple device that is less than 6 years old DO NOT TAKE IT TO THIS PLACE unless you need data recovery.","date":"2016-08-25 13:39:33"}

The service people were very nice, they did a great job on cleaning my car (inside and out), and the prices were a bit high but not too extreme. The place was moderately crowded when I went, but they cleaned my car rather quickly, which was nice. The waiting area (only for people getting their car detailed or getting the Full Service interior cleaning) is nice, clean, has coffee, and nice bathrooms.\nHowever, the communication from the workers was non-existent or confusing and driving around the huge complex is a bit overwhelming. It was fairly easy to find the automatic washer, but trying to choose the wash, plus the interior clean, plus pay for it all was extremely complicated and involved the big machine by the automatic washing area, plus a worker with an iPad, and her \"magic card\", plus my credit card, which I then had to swipe again after my car was done being cleaned. Then, when I got out of the automatic washer, there were 5 people wiping my car down, none of which told me where to go to get the interior cleaned, even though it was plainly marked on my window that I wanted the interior cleaning as well. So, I left the washer, drove through the gas station parking lot next door, back out onto Brodie Lane, back into the huge complex for Palms and wandered a bit until I found an area marked Full Service and Detailing. Then I pulled into an empty stall, got out, and just stood there until one of the other workers came up to me asked what I was doing. So that was odd and confusing, but the people were nice and they did a good job in the end.\nOverall I'm very happy with their work and the price so I'll certainly come back regularly, especially now that I know where to go in the maze that is Palms at each step of the car washing process!","date":"2014-04-01 03:21:50"}

Wow, this place gets crazy busy sometimes. The people here aren't that nice either, at least the several times I have been here.. Not the clientele, not the staff. When it is busy, the wait for ordering a drink was so long I just went ahead and ordered two beers.\n\nI also take issue with the beer selection. No craft beer on tap and only a couple in bottles just doesn't do it for me. I'm sure you can get all the domestic and liquor that your heart desires so this might not be an issue for everyone. I find the layout of Tequila Cowboy to be perplexing. Stairs in odd places, lots of hallways and turns, things both upstairs and down. I am never quite sure where to go. One thing is for sure though, it is LOUD no matter where you go. With the music and karaoke bar, really the only place to have conversation would be outside on the patio. Be prepared for smokers there. The bathrooms are tucked away in a corner and once they actually had an attendant there, so bring some small bills for tipping.\n\nI tried the food once. It was ok. Not much more to say about that. Pretty standard bar fare potato skins. For upsides, the bands are usually pretty good. The decor is pretty decent too, with some fun murals to look at. There is plenty of parking if you go around back, which is just a short walk away.","date":"2015-03-04 19:31:39"}

Read this entire post to understand this update. \n\nI usually do not write reviews for places right away, unless they go above and beyond, and do something great in customer service. \n\nOkay folks listen up. I went in to get my tire fixed. I ran over a pretty big nail at some point and had been riding on a spare for a day. I met with the customer service man and he inspected my tire, and all the others, to see what level they're at. I already knew I am going to need new ones, but they had to see if they could even fix it, because once a tire reaches a certain level of tread, they can no longer repair holes. Luckily they did not try to lie and tell me that I needed to get new tires. I was at just the right amount to get it plugged, which is good because I am not ready this month financially to get a new set all around. \n\nThey guy I spoke with, which his name seems to escape me now, so please forgive me. I know I should have memorized his name since I am so impressed and all, but I am the worst for names. Anywho, this guy did show me that even with his higher end tire, it would still be cheaper for me to purchase a set there versus the dealership I got my new car from. The lowest end was 50 dollars a tire, and guaranteed for 35,000 miles. That's pretty good. \n\nHere's why I will go back. They took my car in and fixed it in under 20 minutes. The guy who did the repair, a different gentleman, came out and informed me he would be pulling it up front for me, nice. Then I turn to the guy who I gave all my info to and asked what the total damage was, and you know what he says. \"You don't owe us anything Chad, it's free tire repair here.\" Yeah he called me by my name, lol. That wasn't what impressed me though. He wants my business, so he just did that for me. I was already going to come back in a month to get new tires, before I trade in my car for a Jeep, because it was a good deal for the set of tires. Now though, they have a customer for life, and that I can guarantee. \n\nOh, and one more thing. The rims they have there are so nice and moderately priced too. There was this sick gunmetal black rim I loved, but I don't want to invest in my car I am trading up, that ran for 99 dollars each, and another which was chrome and black for like 109 dollars each. That's awesome! Just saying folks, do yourself a favor and at least go hear what they have to offer, if that's something you're going to need soon.","date":"2015-03-04 20:32:47"}

Mmm I love pistachio and rosewater.","date":"2010-01-08 01:05:05"}

The owner is an older bald man- he runs the store with his equally bald son. I don't know about the son, but the owner is very knowledgable about his animals and really seems to care about them, though he runs his shop like a business as to be expected. The store is small and cramped and is often dirty, but this is to be expected at a small, independently owned pet shop. This man told me he has had this store for 40 years!\n\nWe talked about rabbits (I have a Holland Lop) and he told me about how he was taking care of a Holland Lop rabbit that someone had literally dumped on the sidewalk outside of his store. His dogs (including a giant friendly Newfoundland named Sammy) and a pair of black-and-white cats serve as greeters and mascots of the store.\n\nI personally was not affronted by the smell of the place. Yes, it smells, but when don't animals smell when you probably have at least 50 animals and 2 people to clean? Even for that, it doesn't smell that bad- it smells like my rabbit's cage after a few days. The owner lets the parrots in the back of the store roam around sometimes and it's pretty dirty in that back room, so if you are willy nilly about those things, don't go back there.\n\nThe prices are a bit high here but I consider that the price of supporting a family business. \n\nTo address the claim of \"animal cruelty\" and \"unscrupulous breeding,\" I have never witnessed anything to say this. I will agree that a couple of the parrots have medical issues (there is one who likes to pull out some of his feathers), but I also know the owner often takes in rescued animals.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this place. If you are looking for a spic-and-span, glossy-floored store like Petco, go to Petco.","date":"2013-01-02 15:23:16"}

Rolling back in a lounge chair recliner made it feel like I was back home enjoying a movie and popcorn with my sweetheart. The service was excellent and non intrusive, perfect for a theater.\n\nMy only hesitation to going back would be the obvious need to gel my hair and do fist pumps upon entering the establishment. Walking through the lobby felt like an episode of Jersey Shore, and the prices matched as well (it is in the Domain after all).\n\nOverall, great experience and would go back for another date night.","date":"2013-06-24 13:35:54"}

I've been going to her for 5 or 6 years now and she's so good that I refuse to let anyone else cut my hair. She's a rare unicorn of a hairstylist in that she truly gets how curls work and how to make them look awesome. I've actually been stopped by strangers multiple times before and asked where I get my hair cut! Meg will gladly give me whatever cut I like, but she also gives great advice on what's likely to work well. In my experience, that advice has always been right.

I've been to both the Chestnut Hill and now the Cambridge locations and both suffer from lack of freshness and a very artificial taste.  \n\nMost recently, I got a 6 pack of cupcakes to go at the Cambridge location which cost me a total of $19.15 (about $3.20 each).  When I got home, I realized cupcake carrier they use is not sufficient - the cupcakes are so tiny that they shifted around in the box and made a little bit of a mess (see photo).  The cupcakes weren't for any special presentation, just to satisfy my late night sweet tooth, so I didn't mind their appearance. \n\nBut I can not tolerate the staleness of the cupcakes and their very artificial taste - not when I'm paying $3.20 each for a cupcake about an inch and 1\/2 in diameter!!  I had a pink lemonade, rootbeer float, and a blueberry pie.  ALL TERRIBLE TASTING!   I don't even want the other 3 I purchased so they are going in the trash.  \n\nThe best cupcakes in Boston area is by far Georgetown cupcakes!   Their store traffic is so high you never run into staleness.  Their cupcakes also just have a rich quality with out tasing too artificial.  \n\nSave your money and avoid Sweet Bakery!!","date":"2018-07-17 00:38:26"}

I heard Beaverton Toyota was the best place in Oregon to purchase a new car. Only half true. My partner and I walked inside and asked for assistance near the Toyota Corolla section and said someone would be out to meet us shortly. We stood by the car of our choice for 20 minutes in the pouring rain and no one came. There was another salesman helping someone and we asked him if he could send someone to help us. Another 20 minutes pass and no one shows up. I call the dealership and the receptionist was very kind and apologized many times and someone was out within 5min. I told the salesman I wasnt looking to buy today and that I wanted to look at my options. We took the car I wanted for a test drive and I absolutely loved it. The car felt planted, even on wet surfaces. The route the salesman took us on had l sorts of turns and speeds to get a feel of the car. We went inside and took down my information. He asked if I wanted to buy the car today. I repeated myself and told him I was only looking for today. He started getting aggressive and intimidating about making the sales. He kept disappapearing every couple minutes, even while we were talking.  Broadway Toyota may have a state of the art facility and greatest selection, but their service is absolutely terrible and not worth buying my car there.","date":"2015-01-18 17:18:41"}
